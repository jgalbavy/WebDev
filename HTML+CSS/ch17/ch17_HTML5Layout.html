        <h3>New HTML5 elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>*Header and *Footer: A main header / footer to appear at top and bottom of every page. <br>
                Or a header / footer for an individual article / section. <br>
            </li>
            <li>*Nav: Contains the major navigational blocks on the site.(think links on the bottom of every page)</li>
            <li>*article: acts as a container for any section that could potentially stand alone and be syndicated (think how a search engine could use this) <br>
            Could be any individual article or blog entry, a comment, or forum post, or any other independent piece of content</li>
            <li>*aside: has two purposes depending on if it is inside an article or not <br>
            When aside is used inside an *article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to the overall meaning (pullquote or glossory). <br>
            When used outside of *article it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page (links to sections of the site, list of recent posts, search box, recent tweets, etc. you have seen this before)</li>
            <li>*section: groups related content together and typically each section would have its own heading <br>
            Ex: a homepage there may be severeal *section elements to contain different sections of the page such as latest news, top products, and newsletter signup</li>
            <li>*hgroup: Heading Groups is to group together a set of one or more *h1 through *h6 elements so that they are treated as ONE</li>
            <li>*figure and *figcaption: already saw *figure in ch5 looking at images but it can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of the article. should be used to REFERENCE <br>
            Examples include: Images, Videos, Graphs, Diagrams, Code samples, and Text that supports the main body of article. <br>
            Should also include *figcaption to describe the figure.</li>
            <li>*div: This is still useful!! Other than what the new elements have been propsed for, use div! </li>
            <li>*a href to entire body. Cool!</li>
            <li>Old Browser support: Need to add CSS and HTML code to specify</li>

        </ul>
