        <h1>Key Concepts in Positing Elements</h1>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Building Blocks</li>
                <p>Css treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box (either block level or inline box).</p>
                <li>Containing Elements</li>
                <p>If one block level element sits inside another block0leel element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element</p>
                <li>Controlling the Position of Elements</li>
                <p>CSS has the following positing schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal Flow: Every block level element appears on a new line caysing each item to apear lower down the page than the prevoius one.They will not appear side by side.</li>
                    <li>Relative Poistioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have veen placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.</li>
                    <li>Absolute Positioning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would hav etaken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.</li>
                    <li>Fixed Positioning: This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.</li>
                    <li>Floating Elements: Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block level celment around which other content can flow.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
