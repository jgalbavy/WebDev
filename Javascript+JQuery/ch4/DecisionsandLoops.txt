How to create and control the flow of data.

Evaluations: you an analyze valyes in your scripts to determine whether or not they match expected results.
    === is strict equal to. both data type and value are the same.
    !== strict not equal to. 


Decisions: using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.
    if (score >= 50) {
        msg += 'Congragulations';
    }
    pretty typical if.

    switch (level) {
        case 'One':
            title = "lelel2";
            break;

        default:
            title - 'test';
            break;
    }
    normal switch

    Type Coercion and Weak Typing: if you use a type JS does not expect, it will try it anyways.
    This means that EVERY value in JS can be treated as TRUE (Truthy) or FALSE (Falsy).



Loops: there are also many occassions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly
    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        // code
    }
    // normal java Loops
