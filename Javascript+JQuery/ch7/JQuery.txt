Perform tasks

Handle Events

Its basically just a library

$('li.hot').addClass('complete'); ==> do something with the element using jQuery methods

Why use jQuery?
    Its just JS, but WAY SIMPLER
    1. Simple Selectors with CSS
    2. Common Tasks in less code
    3. Cross browser compatebility

Lots of ways to find elements with jQuery

Now do stuff with your selection
    Once you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is returned AKA matched set or a jQuery slection.

Looping: when a selector returns multole elelements, you just need one method and not a Looping

Chaining: can chain methods to a selection of elements.

.html and .text to retrieve and update content of the elements

Can get and set CSS properties
    $(li).css('background-color', '#272727');

.each() apply anonymous function to entire list

Placing scripts
    1. In the Head: avoid it will load page slow
    2. In the page: still slow
    3. before </body> this is ideal

api.jquery.com
can extend with plugins

Summary
    Good 'libary'
    Fast and easy (than js)
