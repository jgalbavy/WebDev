JS is case senseative!!! (WHY?!)

Variables: use camelCase
var myQuantity = 3;

Data Types: Numeric, String, Boolean, etc.

Variable Rules:
    1. Name must begin with $ or _ NOT a number.
    2. No - or . in the name
    3. No Keywords
    4. Case senseative
    5. Use a useful name
    6. camelCase
    Typical rules.

Arrays

var colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];

or 

var colors = new Array('white', 'black', 'custom');

Typical Array stuff.

Expressions - yep JS has it.

Operators - yep

String stuff: just the + (join)
