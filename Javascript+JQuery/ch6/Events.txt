Events - "Hey this just happened"

Interactions create Events

Events trigger code

Code Responds to user

----

Different event types:
evets are fired or are raised, they happen

Event Handling-
    select the elements
    indicate which event the selected nodes will trigger the response
    state the code you want to run when it occurs

DO NOT USE HTML EVENT HANDLER ATTRIBUTES

use dom event handlers

Event listeners -> like android studio!

Event Flow - The flow only really matters when your code has event handlers on an element and one of its realted elements

EVENT OBJECT - tells information about event and the element it happened upon

Event Delegation

Can even tell which key is pressed
