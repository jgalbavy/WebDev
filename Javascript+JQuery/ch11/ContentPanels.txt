Basically little secitons of content in limited space (window, slider, accordian,, etc)

Remember that:
    HTML is responsible for structuring conten
    CSS is responsible for presentation
    JS is responsible for behavior

Accordion
    clicking on the title expands it
    typically an UL

Modal Window 
    any content that appears "in front" of the page and must be closed
    script can contain module pattern - for both public and private logic

Photo Viewer
    ex of an image gallery
    when you click on a thumbail, the main photo is replaced with new image
    Async loading and chasing images

Responsive Slider 
    name says it all
